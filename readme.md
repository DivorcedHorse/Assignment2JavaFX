# Assignment 2: WAR - Hao Tran and Daniel Tellez

WAR is a two-player (and three-player) card game where players play in rounds
dealing cards from their personal hand until they run out of cards.  A round is won
with the player who played the highest value card for that round.  If two players
play a card of the same value, a WAR occurs.  Players then play a face down card,
and play another card.  Player with the highest card wins all the cards of that round.
